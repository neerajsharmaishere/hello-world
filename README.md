# hello-world
This is my first repository on github as a demo to understand how github works.
upto this point I have understood how to create a repository and how to create a new branch.
A branch is used to create new updates and then it is saved as commits.
or we can say commits are saved changes.
every branch that commits any change are reflected in master branch.
